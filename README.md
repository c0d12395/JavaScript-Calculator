## Inspiration
This is the first hackathon I have attended and I don't have much experience so I wanted to do something very simple to teach myself something new. I decided to do a simple calculator because I felt like that might be something I can actually finish.
## What it does
It does simple math with on screen buttons or keyboard input. There is also an animation when the number 420 is the result.
## How I built it
I wrote out basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript in Notepad++ and added the site to a Debian server with Apache.
## Challenges I ran into
Having the calculator correctly handle buttons pressed at odd times. Like for example pressing a second operator or pressing equals before having two numbers and an operator. I also had a hard time with making the animation smooth.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Teaching myself the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as hosting a site with Apache. I am also proud of making a program that doesn't break from anything strange I have tried to do with it so far.
## What I learned
The basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also learned how to host a site with Apache.
## What's next for JavaScript Calculator
Making it look a little nicer and adding more buttons like parentheses.
